As HeatSuite was designed to be a researcher first tool, it does not come with pre-defined questions. You are in full control of what questions you want to ask, and their design - within the limits of the software. In brief, the best questions are short with simple responses (one/two words per option).</p>"},{"location":"watchapp-ema/#how-do-i-add-ema-questions","title":"How do I add EMA questions?","text":"<p>Adding EMA to the watch app requires you to simply upload a properly formatted heatsuite.survey.json file to the watch.

However, if you want restrict the question to only be visible in the morning, you would adjust to <code>[0,1159]</code>. If you only want questions to be restricted to specific times of day, you can add multiple time windows in the array like this: <code>\"tod\":[[0,1159],[1400,1800]]</code>. In this example, you will only see the question between 00:00 &amp; 11:59, or 14:00 &amp; 18:00. * <code>oncePerDay</code>(optional): a boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) to restrict the question to only appear once a day. * <code>orderFix</code> (optional): a boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) to fix the order of this question if you have selected question randomization in HeatSuite settings. * <code>options</code>: an array <code>[]</code> of objects <code>{}</code> containing details for each option to present for the user to select. Within each object, you have the following options:     * <code>text</code>: and object <code>{}</code> containing your language specific (key) option text (value).     * <code>value</code>: the numerical value you wish for response coding.     * <code>color</code>: The color of the option text.     * <code>btnColor</code>: The color of the option background.</p>"},{"location":"watchapp-tasks/","title":"HeatSuite Watch App - Tasks","text":""},{"location":"watchapp-tasks/#what-are-tasks","title":"What are tasks?","text":"<p>Similar to the question-based ecological momentary assessments, you can also add tasks to your HeatSuite install for users to perform.
